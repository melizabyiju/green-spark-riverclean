## Project Title
RiverClean

## Problem Statement Addressed
"How might we build and deploy technology-driven solutions that actively promote cleaner, greener communities and environmental sustainability?"
Water pollution in rivers is a critical environmental issue, often going unreported due to lack of easy, accessible tools for the public to participate in monitoring. 


## Project Overview
A web application that enables community-driven detection of river pollution using AI-powered image analysis.

##  Approach & Solution

- **Community-driven Reporting:** Users upload river or creek photos via a web interface.
- **AI Detection:** A trained deep learning model classifies images as "Clean" or "Polluted".
- **Rewards & Tracking:** Users receive recognition for their contributions and can see reported locations.
- **Authorities Notification:** When pollution is detected, authorities can be notified automatically.
- **Dashboard & Stats:** Users can view their cleanups, rewards, and location history.


## Key Features
- Upload river/creek images to detect pollution.
- Instant results with AI-powered analysis.
- User rewards system (points/badges).
- Dashboard to see stats and history.
- Simple, modern user interface.
- Authority notification for polluted reports.

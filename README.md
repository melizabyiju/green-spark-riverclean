## Project Title
RiverClean

## Problem Statement Addressed
"How might we build and deploy technology-driven solutions that actively promote cleaner, greener communities and environmental sustainability?"

## Project Overview
Water pollution in rivers is a critical environmental issue, often going unreported due to lack of easy, accessible tools for the public to participate in monitoring.

## Key Features
- Upload river/creek images to detect pollution.
- Instant results with AI-powered analysis.
- User rewards system (points/badges).
- Dashboard to see stats and history.
- Simple, modern user interface.
- Authority notification for polluted reports.
